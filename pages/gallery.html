                <h4>Story of the year: Saving Forests with Fire</h4>
                <p>Indigenous Australians strategically burn land in a practice known as cool burning, in which fires move slowly, burn only the undergrowth, and remove the buildup of fuel that feeds bigger blazes. The Nawarddeken people of West Arnhem Land have been practising controlled cool burns for tens of thousands of years and see fire as a tool to manage their 1.39m-hectare homeland“It was so well put together that you cannot even think of the images in disparate ways. You look at it as a whole, and it was very well done” </p>

                <h4>Long-term project award: Amazonian Dystopia</h4>
                <p>The Amazon rainforest is under great threat, as deforestation, mining, infrastructural development and exploitation of other natural resources gain momentum under President Jair Bolsonaro’s environmentally regressive policies. Since 2019, devastation of the Brazilian Amazon has been running at its fastest pace in a decade. An area of extraordinary biodiversity, the Amazon is also home to more than 350 different Indigenous groups.“This project portrays something that does not just have negative effects on the local community but also globally, as it triggers a chain of reactions on a global level”</p>

                <h4>Open format award: Blood is a Seed</h4>
                <p>Through personal stories, La Sangre Es Una Semilla questions the disappearance of seeds, forced migration, colonisation, and the subsequent loss of ancestral knowledge. The video is composed of digital and film photographs, some of which were taken on expired 35mm film and later drawn on by Romero’s father. In a journey to their ancestral village of Une, Cundinamarca, Colombia, Romero explores forgotten memories of the land and crops and learns about her grandfather and great-grandmother who were ‘seed guardians’.“There are so many layers to this narrative in terms of her use of audio, video, stills and sequencing”</p>

                <p>Palestinian children hold candles during a rally amid the ruins of houses destroyed by Israeli strikes, in Beit Lahia in May 2021. Gaza residents returned to damaged and destroyed homes as the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appeared to be holding. The ceasefire ended 11 days of fighting that killed more than 250 Palestinians, many of them women and children, and 13 Israelis</p>

                <p>Hrushevskoho street in Kyiv, on 22 January 2014, the second day of violent confrontations between law enforcement and pro-EU protestors. The special anti-riot units, the Berkouts, use weapons against the masses. At the end of the day, they count five dead and many hundred wounded.
